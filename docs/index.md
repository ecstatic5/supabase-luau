# supabase-luau

Meet `supabase-luau`, a **ModuleScript** for managing [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) from Roblox Studio.

## What is the use of supabase-luau?

The use of supabase-luau is to manage a `relational database` (SQL) using **Postgresql** and **Supabase**.

I have made this ModuleScript for the developer community, and also to try to improve data persistence in Roblox, as DataStores can be very annoying and tedious to use.

## What is the purpose of supabase-luau?

The purpose of supabase-luau is to simplify too much the tedious task of persisting data in your game, it also gives you the benefit of being able to visualize and manage your data in the Supabase dashboard.

> The purpose of this modulescript is not to replace DataStores, this script was made by and for the community, I do not want to replace the use of DataStores at all, as they can be useful in many cases
