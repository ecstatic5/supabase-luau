## supabase-luau creation history

[supabase-luau](https://github.com/ecstatic5/supabase-luau) was mainly thought to use it privately myself, I was developing a game in which I needed to list items from a [DataStore](https://create.roblox.com/docs/es-es/cloud-services/datastores), but I still needed to store a table with all the necessary, but the problem is that the [OrderedDataStore](https://create.roblox.com/docs/es-es/reference/engine/classes/OrderedDataStore) does not allow to store items other than numbers, so the option I used, was to create **2 DataStores**, one which stores an ID that refers to the table of the other DataStore that I want to retrieve.

The problem with this system I made, is that it was too slow and the code was not scalable, so I remembered that [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) had a REST-API which I used to make this easier, once I had finished programming the module, I put it approved. By using it I didn't need to use the system I did before, and my game code went from +500 lines of code to just 1.

## Why should you use it?
